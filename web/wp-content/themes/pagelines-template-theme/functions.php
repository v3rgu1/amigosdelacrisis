// ABOUT HOOKS --------//
	// Hooks are a way to easily add custom functions and content to PageLines. There are hooks placed strategically throughout the theme 
	// so that you insert code and content with ease.


// ABOUT FILTERS ----------//

	// Filters allow data modification on-the-fly. Which means you can change something after it was read and compiled from the database,
	// but before it is shown to your visitor. Or, you can modify something a visitor sent to your database, before it is actually written there.

// FILTERS EXAMPLE ---------//

	// The following filter will add the font  Ubuntu into the font array $thefoundry.
	// This makes the font available to the framework and the user via the admin panel.
